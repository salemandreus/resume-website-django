## My Resumé Website, now in Django.

This is my resumé website, which I host on Github as my user/organization site.

The Django version isn't currently hosted live (GitHub Pages doesn't support that).

You can browse the static version of the site [here](https://salemandreus.github.io) .

That version connects to [this repo](https://github.com/salemandreus/salemandreus.github.io), which this repo was created as a mirror of.
