    <ul>
        <li>Prior to the pandemic, I would actively seek out tech events, hackathons, and other meetups where I could give back to the community, and as I transition back into the industry, I would like to do that again.</li>
        <li>I enjoyed tech meetups with such groups as Women in Tech Cape Town, Kat-O (electronics), PythonSA, and Codebridge as well as the monthly Make Games SA meetups.</li>
        <li>I'm always on the lookout for new and interesting tech events to participate in, such as ScaleConf, DevConf and BSides, and participating in a Make event on Rootâ€™s insurance and programmable bank account APIs.</li>
        <li>Some other hackathons and game jams I have participated in include the Santam IOT Safety Hackathon, Unearthed Mining Hackathon and the Global Game Jams, Amaze Johannesburg, Super Friendship Arcade, SA Game Jam events, and others.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>I feel it is important to support the community as a developer, to help bridge the gap experienced by many people not privileged to be afforded the same access to opportunity - with WhereIsMyTransport I've volunteered developer support through our Public Transport API at a hackathon co-hosted with Women In Tech in 2017.</li>
        <li>In 2016/2017 I volunteered in several events as a code coach, speaker, and mentor at Code4CT, an organisation that teaches underprivileged girls to code, both on behalf of WhereIsMyTransport and also later in my personal capacity, as I have a strong passion for increasing diversity in the software, tech, and games industries.</li>
        <li>I was also invited to speak on a panel at Life Choices, an event aimed more generally at helping people in other industries transition into software careers.</li>
        <li>When I had the time I was involved in Tech-for-Good and Coding Soup, a biweekly initiative by the non-profit Codebridge centred around making community data more widely available to the public. I also became involved in ColorCode - a biweekly meetup that encourages collaboration, supporting new developers and those keen to pivot in their coding careers.</li>
